# asterisk-config-templates

Basic Asterisk getting going templates

Mimimal templates to enable a simple Astersik to run on the test bench.

Passwords are easily guessable and the same for all extensions.

Tested on packaged Asterisk 16 using Debian Buster

Put your local config in to a folder called local_cfg/ as this is in the .gitignore and included from the main files
